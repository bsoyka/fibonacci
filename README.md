# Fibonacci Day
This is a program that was made to celebrate Fibonacci Day 2018 (11/23/2018).  This program calculates the `n`th number of the Fibonacci sequence.
## Limits
The main `fib` function in `main.py` accepts one argument, `n`.  `n` must be an integer greater than or equal to 1.  Also, due to Python's recursion limits, `n` must be less than or equal to 998.
